Friendly was my final class project, completed in 10 days to showcase the 
variety of skills/competencies covered in the course.

PLS NOTE, the site requires an API key to function. The code without a key is broken.

Friendly was started from the desire to make it easier for consumers to buy from/support
companies who share similar values. A broad area to cover, Friendly focuses specifically 
on identifying businesses that are LGBTQ friendly based on data from the publicly published 
2018 US Human Rights Campaign Fund's Corporate Equality Index. 

Friendly uses Google Maps to allow users to quickly and easily search for nearby businesses that
score high for LGBTQ-friendliness. Once a user searches a specific keyword or name of a business 
(ex. coffee or Starbucks) then the map displays with pins for 20 corresponding businesses nearby. 
Those businesses that score high for LGBTQ-friendliness per the 3rd party data, are indicated with
customized rainbow pin along with their score out of 100 from the HRCF study.

Additional funcationality wishlist:
- Canadian-specific data similar to the data from the HRCF's study
- ability for local businesses to self-report as LGBTQ-friendly on the site and be integrated in 
to the search functionality with different visual language to show different data set.

Beyond LGBTQ, I envision this site could also incorporate data in other areas to help consumers
support businesses that line up with their own value system. For example, I would love to show 
businesses that are the most eco-friendly, have the best accessibility, and more.
