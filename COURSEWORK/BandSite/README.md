BandSite was created for a class assignment.
The project ran over 3 Sprints, based on the following requirements.
The version on GitHub is from the (final) 3rd SPRINT.
 
SPRINT 1
Using a supplied design package (assets, style guide, spec sheet, and creative mockup) 
create a responsive site. (Not all aspects of the site are required to fully function).

- site must be responsive and closely match mockups provided
- CSS must use SASS variables & BEM principles
- must use Flexbox for layout control


SPRINT 2
Using JavaScript add basic interactivity/functionality to the site.
Create a multipage site by adding a second page to the site.

- project must follow proper folder structure and naming convention outlined in the project guidelines
- site must be responsive and therefore should closely resemble the mockups in the design package
- CSS must use SASS variables & BEM principles
- must use Flexbox for layout control
- "Comments" section must function using DOM manipulation


SPRINT 3
Extend the functionality of the multi-page site by connecting to an API which will serve the 
comments and shows data.

- project must follow proper folder structure and naming convention outlined in the project guidelines
- site must be responsive and therefore should closely resemble the mockups in the design package
- CSS must use SASS variables & BEM principles
- must use Flexbox for layout control
- must use axios (imported using a CDN) or FETCH for the API HTTP requests
- must use addEventListener to register your event handler functions
- given the provided API, refactor the existing functionality to use the API endpoints as a datasource. 
- GET & POST requests should be used for the 'Comments' section functionality
- GET requests should be used for the "Shows" data
- must use Postman to test endpoints
