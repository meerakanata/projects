InventorySite was created as a group assigment for class.
It is a barebones Ice Cream Inventory and Tracking Application for a fake Ice Cream vendor.

The purpose of the assignment was twofold:
- continue building upon what we've covered thus far in the course: HTML, JavaScript, CSS, SASS, React, Node, npm, Express, etc.
- continue to learn and employ Agile working methodology, working in sprints, and utilizing tools as a group like: Git version control, Kanban, JIRA, etc.
